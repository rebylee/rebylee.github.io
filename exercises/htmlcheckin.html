        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of all purpose | plain flour, (290 g | 10 oz)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetner, (60 g | 2 oz)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups milk, (440 ml)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, (60 g | 2 oz)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetner), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
            <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay). **The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency**.</li>
            <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
            <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
        </ol>
